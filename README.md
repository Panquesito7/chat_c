# chat_c
## How to install:
Extract ZIP file and place in mods/. Alternatively, you can simply "git clone https://github.com/wilkgr76/chat_c" from within the mods directory.
## How to use:
Players can prefix their messages with a letter (or series of letters) and it will colour their message. 
* b (blue)
* lb (lightblue)
* g (green)
* lg (lightgreen)
* r (red)
* p (pink)

## Example
Example: If the player chats "g Thank you wilkgr", then other players will see "<you> Thank you wilkgr", where "Thank you wilkgr" is green. Now that I've explained it, it sounds complicated. It isn't - just try it!
